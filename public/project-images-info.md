# Project Images

Since we're using the existing GIFs as placeholders, we'll keep the current setup but you can replace these with actual project screenshots later.

The current projects are using:
- /coding.gif for coding projects
- /brain.gif for AI/ML projects  
- /heart.gif for general projects

For better project showcase, consider adding:
- project-quantum-trading.png
- project-transparency-now.png
- project-nba-predictor.png
- project-wiki-olympics.png
- project-chess-game.png
- project-portfolio.png
