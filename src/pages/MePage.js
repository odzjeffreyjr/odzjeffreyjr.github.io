                Hello! I'm Jeffrey Oduman, a passionate Computer Science and Robotics student at the University of Pennsylvania. 
                My journey into technology began in Uganda, where I developed a deep fascination with how computers and artificial 
                intelligence can solve real-world problems and create meaningful impact in people's lives.

                Currently pursuing a dual degree in BSE Computer Science and MSE Robotics with a focus on AI, I'm constantly 
                exploring the intersection of software engineering, machine learning, and robotics. My work spans from building 
                AI-powered social media platforms to developing autonomous robotic systems, always with an eye toward innovation 
                and practical application.

                When I'm not coding or working on research projects, you'll find me mentoring fellow students, contributing to 
                open-source projects, or diving deep into the latest advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics. 
                I believe in the power of technology to bridge gaps, create opportunities, and build a better future for everyone.

                technical excellence but also have a positive impact on society. Whether it's through developing intelligent 
                systems, conducting cutting-edge research, or building the next generation of autonomous technologies, I'm 
                committed to pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

                I'm also a part-time football debater, and self-declared Messi missionary (praying for Ronaldo fans). When I'm not trying to convince robots to do my chores, you will find me knee-deep in arguments about why Messi is the undisputed GOAT, complete with screenshots, spreadsheets, and probably a PowerPoint presentation titled "Chapter 10: The Pass that Wiped 1 Billion USD off the French Stock Market."
